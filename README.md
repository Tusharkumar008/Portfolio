# Portfolio
I am Tushar Kumar, a dedicated and passionate student of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology at NSHM Knowledge Campus, Durgapur, with a CGPA of 8.43. My academic journey has been complemented by practical experiences, such as an internship at EBest Solution, where I worked on designing and implementing machine learning models and cloud computing solutions. I have hands-on experience in Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, AWS, and NLP, which I leveraged to develop projects like a Chatbot inspired by ChatGPT using the LLama-2 Language Model.

I also led a Parkinson's Disease Prediction project where I developed a reliable early diagnosis tool using clinical data and advanced machine learning techniques. My technical skills extend to data analysis, where I have created interactive dashboards using Power BI for superstore sales analysis.

Driven by a strong work ethic and a passion for solving complex problems, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world applications. I am continuously learning and aiming to contribute meaningfully to impactful projects that leverage AI and ML to solve pressing challenges.
